# Cryptography Lab Implementations

This repository contains implementations of cryptography laboratory experiments done as part of an academic course.

## Experiments Included

### 1. Caesar Cipher
- Encryption and decryption using shift key
- Brute-force attack demonstration
- Time measurement for breaking the cipher
- Analysis of weak key space

### 2. Simplified DES (S-DES)
- Implementation of S-DES block cipher
- Modes of operation:
  - ECB (Electronic Codebook)
  - CBC (Cipher Block Chaining)
  - CFB (Cipher Feedback)
  - OFB (Output Feedback)
  - CTR (Counter Mode)
- Comparison of pattern leakage and security properties

### 3. Weak Modular Authentication
- Demonstration of authentication weaknesses using composite modulus
- Replay attack
- Token prediction attack
- Impersonation attack
- GCD-based mathematical attack
- Prevention using prime modulus and validation checks

## Technologies Used
- C
- Python 3

## Purpose
This repository is intended for academic learning and demonstration of cryptographic concepts.  
It highlights why classical and weak cryptographic systems are insecure and how modern techniques improve security.
